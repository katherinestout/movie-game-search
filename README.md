# Rotten Potato

"Because just watching the movie is not bad enough..."

###
The rotten potato application is useful for the video game or movie fanatic. 
It's an 80's theme with loads of flashy and interactive content.
Simply search for your favorite movie to find video games, and to find YouTube trailors based off of those video games, and vice versa. 

Our motivation for making this application was to connect people with what they love.

Click the movies and or video games search bar, and then plug in your favorite movie to display video games (or video games based off of movies) and YouTube trailors based off of what you search.
